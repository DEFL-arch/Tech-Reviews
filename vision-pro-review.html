                    <li>**Unmatched micro-OLED displays** offer incredible visual fidelity.</li>
                    <li>Intuitive and futuristic **eye-and-hand tracking** input.</li>
                    <li>Seamless integration with the existing Mac and iPhone ecosystem.</li>
                    <li>Exceptional video passthrough, blurring the line of mixed reality.</li>

            <div class="cons">
                <h4>CONS</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Excessive weight and bulk** make long sessions uncomfortable.</li>
                    <li>The external battery pack is an inconvenience, not a feature.</li>
                    <li>**Lack of compelling, non-professional applications** outside of media consumption.</li>
                    <li>The price remains a massive barrier for mainstream adoption.</li>
                </ul>

        <p>The Vision Pro is arguably the most impressive piece of technology Apple has launched in a decade. The clarity, the fidelity, and the input method are truly science fiction made real. However, the widespread criticism remains: **this is a development platform, not a daily driver**.</p>
        
        <h2>The Comfort and Use Barrier</h2>
        <p>For all its technical prowess, the device is simply too heavy. After 45 minutes of use, the pressure on the face becomes noticeable, and for many users, headaches quickly follow. The detached battery pack, while necessary for weight distribution, is a clumsy solution that kills the mobility the device promises. This is a powerful, tethered **desk computer** worn on the head, not a wearable for walking around.</p>
        
        <h2>The Software Situation</h2>
        <p>While the macOS integration is excellent for developers and power users, the "Killer App" for the average consumer is missing. Watching movies is incredible, but that alone doesn't justify the exorbitant price tag. Until developers create truly necessary, life-changing spatial computing apps, the Vision Pro will remain a very expensive, niche toy.</p>
